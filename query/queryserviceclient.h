         *
         * The QueryServiceClient provides an easy way to access the %Nepomuk Query Service
         * without having to deal with any communication details. By default it monitors
         * queries for changes.
         *
         * Usage is simple: Create an instance of the client for each search you want to
         * track. One instance may also be reused for subsequent queries if further updates
         * of the persistent query are not necessary.
