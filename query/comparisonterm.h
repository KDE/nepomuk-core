         * \brief A term matching the value of a property.
         *
         * The %ComparisonTerm is the most important term in the query API. It can be
         * used to match the values of properties. As such it consists of a property(),
         * a comparator() and a subTerm().
         *
         * The latter can be any other term including AndTerm and OrTerm. The matching
         * is done in one of two ways:
         *
         * \li A LiteralTerm as subTerm() is directly matched to the value of a literal
         * property (see also Nepomuk::Types::Property::literalRangeType()) or to the
         * labels of related resources in case of a property that has a resource range.
         * \li Any other term type will be used as a sort of subquery to match the
         * related resources. This means that the property() needs to have a resource
         * range.
         *
         * For more details see the Comparator enumeration.
         *
