Nepomuk-test is a static library for building unit tests of KDE/Nepomuk components.

It allows complicated unit tests which make use of a Private DBus Session Bus and a virtuoso
sandbox to avoid making a mess of the nepomuk/dbus installations running on the
system where the tests are run.

When running Nepomuk unit tests please make sure the services you require are running. If they
are not running they can be started via the Nepomuk::TestBase::startService function. All tests
should be derived from the Nepomuk::TestBase class.

By default only 2 services are started -
* Storage
* Query Service

This code is based on the Telepathy Testlib which can be found - https://projects.kde.org/projects/playground/network/telepathy/ktp-testlib

The tests should be run via ctest or make tests.
