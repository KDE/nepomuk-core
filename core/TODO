* Replace nao:label with rdfs:label and introduce nao:prefLabal.
  This has to be accompanied with a module that changes all nao:label occurences to rdfs:label or nao:prefLabel.
* PROBLEM: if we have for example multiple rdfs:label statements for one resource Resource::label().toString() will return
           a comma-separated list which is not what we want at all!
